\item{plot.epi.3d}{If TRUE, draw 3d plot}

\item{plot.epi.2d}{If TRUE, draw 2d plot}

\item{main.epi.3d}{The title of 3d plot. If this argument is NULL, trait name is set as the title.}

\item{main.epi.2d}{The title of 2d plot. If this argument is NULL, trait name is set as the title.}

\item{saveName}{When drawing any plot, you can save plots in png format. In saveName, you should substitute the name you want to save.
When saveAt = NULL, the plot is not saved.}
