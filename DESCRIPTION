Description: By using 'RAINBOWR' (Reliable Association INference By Optimizing Weights with R), users can test multiple SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) simultaneously by kernel-based (SNP-set) methods. This package can also be applied to haplotype-based GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). Users can test not only additive effects but also dominance and epistatic effects. In detail, please check our preprint on bioRxiv: Kosuke Hamazaki and Hiroyoshi Iwata (2019) <doi:10.1101/612028>.
