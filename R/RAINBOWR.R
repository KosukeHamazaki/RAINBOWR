#' RAINBOWR:
#' Perform Genome-Wide Asscoiation Study (GWAS) By Kernel-Based Methods
#' @description By using 'RAINBOWR' (Reliable Association INference By Optimizing Weights with R), users can test multiple SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) simultaneously by kernel-based (SNP-set) methods.
#' Users can test not only additive effects but also dominance and epistatic effects.
#' In detail, please check our preprint on bioRxiv: Kosuke Hamazaki and Hiroyoshi Iwata (2019) <doi:10.1101/612028>.
